# Mood Tracking App 

Created by the elf-gineers

This is the Data Science portion of our project.  This project was completed by Byron Lacuesta (Data Scientist).  

The EDA charts involved in this project were converted to JSON files and added to an interactive dashboard for the

app with the assistance of Robert Ogle (Data Scientist), the software engineering team, and the UX/ UI team.
